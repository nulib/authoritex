The defining elements are often as aesthetic as they are about pure sound. Acoustic sounds are a must, and stringed instruments always work best if finger-picked. Lyrically, evoking the mythical and the pastoral is stock-in-trade. And that romanticism for the land picks up on the hippy spirit, and what might be the genre's most defining quality: sounding out of time.
